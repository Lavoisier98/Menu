Seems like a simple macro-enabled excel spreadsheet, but this one is a toolbox for data analysis and data operation procedures among other worksheets, and it is here to help the Team to organize information oftenly used in expedient, providing you templates to some office works, like emails, PDFs, presentations in pptx/pptm, important links, fixed information to merge and join tables and bringing them (filtered or not) to the spreadsheet in a specific field or bringing the information from one table to another table according to user presetted links among tables to be used as keys in data transfer. Interaction among tables, numbers, labels, dynamic tables and graphics.
